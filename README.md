## Purpose
Make splitting checks simple and easy, and learn something along the way.

## How It Works
I use...
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google/#/) for the amazing splitmycheck.com domain.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for hosting.
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to make app/component development super simple.
- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) to measure how much I'm using the site :D
